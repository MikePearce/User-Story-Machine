There's a lot of scrum/agile tools on the web, so why not one more! Huzzah!

No, seriously, none of them quite did what I wanted, so in the name of being agile, I wrote my own. Feel free to pull it down and mash it up. This includes the full CodeIgniter install aswell.

Oh, it doesn't look pretty either.
